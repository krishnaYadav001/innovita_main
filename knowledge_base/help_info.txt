Problem Definition

Introduction   to   the   Problem:   The   digital   age   has   brought   remarkable advancements in connectivity, creativity, and commerce, but it has also posed unique challenges. Social media platforms have transformed the way people interact, share, and consume   content.   However,   their   algorithms   often   prioritize   entertainment   and sensationalism over educational, creative, or meaningful content. This approach has created an ecosystem where valuable ideas and initiatives, particularly those focusing on sustainability and innovation, struggle to gain visibility.

Additionally,  environmental  issues,  including   excessive  waste  and  unsustainable consumption  patterns,  continue  to  escalate  globally.  Despite  growing  awareness, individuals lack accessible and engaging platforms that promote eco-friendly practices, such as upcycling and recycling. This gap hinders the adoption of sustainable behaviors and stifles creative solutions to these pressing challenges.

Key Issues Identified

1.  Algorithmic  Bias  Towards  Entertainment:  Most  social  media  platforms optimize for engagement metrics like likes, views, and shares, leading to a bias towards viral content. As a result, educational and environmentally conscious content often gets overshadowed, making it difficult for users with meaningful ideas to reach their target audience.
2.  Limited Support for Creativity and Sustainability: While there are platforms dedicated to selling handmade or eco-friendly products, they rarely combine this with tools for content creation, learning, and community building. This disjointed approach limits the impact of creative and sustainable initiatives.
3.  Barriers  to  Monetization  for  Creators:  Many  creators  face  challenges  in monetizing their skills, particularly in niche areas like upcycling or recycling. Current platforms often lack dedicated marketplaces that cater to the unique needs of such creators, leaving them without reliable avenues to generate income.
4.  Environmental Awareness Challenges: Although awareness campaigns about sustainability exist, they often fail to engage younger audiences effectively. The lack of visually appealing and easily consumable content that aligns with modern consumption habits hampers these campaigns' success.

The  Societal  Impact  of  the  Problem:  The  lack  of  a  unified  platform  addressing creativity, sustainability, and monetization results in:






9

Projectanalysis





Study of Existing Systems:

Analysis of Current Social Media Platforms-

Traditional Social Networks:

	CentralizeArchitectures:
Centralized architectures rely on a single point of control and storage, where all user interactions and data are managed by a central server. This setup simplifies data synchronization and control but introduces vulnerabilities:
o  Single Point of Failure: If the central server crashes or is compromised, the  entire  network  becomes  inaccessible.  For  example,  downtime  on platforms like early Facebook could render the service unusable for all users.
o  Data Privacy Risks: Centralization makes platforms attractive targets for hackers, as breaching a single point grants access to extensive user data.
	MonolithicCodebases:
Monolithic systems combine all functionalities into one application, making the codebase large and complex. Key drawbacks include:
o  Deployment Challenges: Releasing updates requires redeploying the entire application, increasing the risk of bugs or downtime.
o  Inflexibility:  Modifying  or  adding  features  can  be  cumbersome  since changes in one module often affect others.
	LimitedScalability:
Traditional networks often depend on vertical scaling (adding more  powerful hardware) rather than horizontal scaling (adding more servers). As user numbers grow,  this  approach  becomes  prohibitively  expensive  and  less  effective.  For example, early social media platforms struggled to support global, simultaneous user interactions.

Modern Platforms:

Core Video Feed:

Users see a main feed ("For You") displaying video posts from various creators.
Videos auto-play when they scroll into view and pause when scrolled away.
Users can navigate between posts on the single post view page using up/down arrows.
User Accounts:

Users can register for a new account or log in with existing credentials.
Users can log out.
Users have profiles displaying their name, bio, profile picture, and uploaded videos.
Users can edit their own profiles (likely via an "Edit profile" button on their profile page).
Uploading & Content Creation:

Logged-in users can access an "Upload" page via the top navigation.
On the Upload page, users select a video file, write a caption, and optionally add details for one primary product to link to the video (Name, Price, URL, Image).
Clicking "Post" uploads the video and caption, and creates/links the product if details were provided.
Post Interactions:

Likes: Users can like/unlike posts by clicking the heart icon. The like count is displayed.
Comments: Users can view comments on a post (likely by clicking the comment icon or on the single post page). Logged-in users can add new comments via an input box. Users can delete their own comments. Comment count is displayed.
Sharing: A share icon exists, and a share count is displayed (the exact sharing mechanism isn't fully detailed in the code reviewed).
Rich Text Editor: An edit icon (pencil) exists next to the like/comment/share buttons. Clicking this opens a modal (EditorModal) containing a rich text editor (RichTextEditor.tsx). This allows the post creator (or potentially others, depending on permissions not fully explored) to add or edit formatted text content associated with the post (e.g., a longer description, instructions, story). The content is saved using useCreateRichText and fetched using useGetRichTextByPostId.
Product Integration:

Shop Page (/shop): Displays a public catalog of all products that have been linked to any video post by any user. Users can click "View Product" to go to the external URL.
Linking on Upload: As mentioned in Uploading.
Viewing on Post: A shop icon appears on video posts that have a linked product. Clicking it opens a modal (ProductInfoModal) showing the product details (image, name, price).
Managing Linked Product (Post Creator): If viewing the product modal on their own post, the creator sees "Edit" and "Delete" buttons instead of "View Product".
"Edit" opens a modal (EditProductModal) to change the product's name, price, URL, or image.
"Delete" removes the product entirely (from the database and Shop page) and unlinks it from the post.
Adding Product After Posting (Post Creator): If a post creator opens the product modal on their own post and no product is linked, they see an "Add Product" button which opens a modal (AddProductModal) to create and link a new product to that specific post.
Admin Page (/admin):

Accessible only to users whose IDs are listed in the NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_USER_IDS environment variable.
Displays all products in a responsive card grid.
Allows admins to "Add New Product" directly to the catalog via a modal.
Allows admins to "Edit" any existing product via a modal.
Allows admins to "Delete" any existing product.
Theme:

Users can toggle between Light and Dark mode using a button (sun/moon icon) in the top navigation bar. The choice is saved locally.
AI Chatbot:

A floating chat button opens a chat window.
Users can ask questions.
The chatbot uses Google Gemini via a backend API route.
It has a basic system prompt defining its role for Innovita.
It uses the content of knowledge_base/help_info.txt to try and answer questions specifically about the site (Retrieval-Augmented Generation - RAG).
